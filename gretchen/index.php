            <h3>The Flame Alphabet</h3>
            <h4>by Ben Marcus</h4>
            <p>In The Flame Alphabet, the most maniacally gifted writer of our generation delivers a novel about how far we will go in order to protect our loved ones.</p>
            <p>The sound of children's speech has become lethal. In the park, adults wither beneath the powerful screams of their offspring. For young parents Sam and Claire, it seems their only means of survival is to flee from their daughter, Esther. But they find it isn't so easy to leave someone you love, even as they waste away from her malevolent speech. On the eve of their departure, Claire mysteriously disappears, and Sam, determined to find a cure for this new toxic language, presses on alone into a foreign world to try to save his family.</p>

            <h3>The Five Simple Machines</h3>
            <h4>by McEwen Todd</h4>
            <p>The lever, wedge, wheel and axle, pulley, screw and inclined plane. Some argue that the plane is an application of the wedge, or vice versa; some insist there’s altogether ‘too much focus on the mechanics’ – but a boy whose dik (sic) is beginning to make nonsense of the fit of his trousers has to begin somewhere. Along the way, fine women are loved and lost, human error is not averted, and much is learned, of both a practical and a speculative nature. ‘The machine,’ says Saint-Exupéry, "does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them."</p>

            <p>"The stories in this book are about reminiscences of sex: relationships that went bad, or were ridiculous, or were mismatches – there's one about a marriage that seems to be working, yet is still radically unsatisfactory. The titles are “six so-called mechanical powers – the lever, wedge, wheel and axle, pulley, screw and inclined plane”. The explanation for the confusion arising from the six mentioned here and the big red “5” on the front cover comes in an italicised form under the chapter headed “Wedge”: “It is well known that, strictly speaking, the wedge is only an application of the inclined plane. But.” And then we’re off: a story in which the girlfriend wears wedge shoes, her car looks like a wedge, and there are wedges driven between the characters.</p>

            <p>This is a rare kind of humour: it is not only a matter of verbal deftness – a word, or a comma, popping up unexpectedly – but of intelligence, lightly applied . . . These stories manage to be unflaggingly funny, yet never wearisome: the tonal control is complete. And the deeper message is that laughter is a cure."</p>

            <h3>Lionel Asbo: State of England </h3>
            <h4>by Martin Amis</h4>
            <p>Des Pepperdine is a boy out of place. He lives on the thirty-third floor of a London housing project; while his peers pick fights, Des retreats to the public library. What’s more, Des’s uncle and guardian, Lionel Asbo, is one of the most notorious petty criminals in the city. Yet Lionel, full of inept devotion to his nephew, dutifully teaches Des the essentials of becoming a man (always carry a knife; pornography is easier than dating; pit bulls should be fed Tabasco sauce). To survive these lessons, Des seeks solace in a covert romantic union that would fill Lionel with rage. But just as Des begins to lead a healthier life, Lionel wins £140 million in the lottery. The money ushers in a public-relations firm for Lionel, along with a cannily ambitious topless model–poet. Through it all, Lionel remains his vicious, oddly loyal self, and his problems, as well as Des’s, only seem to multiply. By turns outrageous and touching, Lionel Asbo is an exuberant Dickensian satire of crime, celebrity, and modern culture.</p>
